## Abstract

Truffle is a framework for building high-performance interpreters, based on
the
new Graal JVM. The combination of Truffle and Graal allows us to write
interpreters instead of compilers, while preserving high performance. Our
proposal is to combine the benefits of Truffle/Graal and Object Algebras in
a
Framework for rapid prototyping of high-performance language
implementations.
The key idea is to use Object Algebras to develop product lines for modular
language components, including Truffle interpreters. Also I will show our
experimental results on composing Python interpreter from our framework.
