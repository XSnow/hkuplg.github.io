## Abstract

EVF is an extensible and expressive Java visitor framework for programming
language reuse. However, restricted by Java, there is a lot of boilerplate
code
that needs to be written by the user in defining and instantiating visitors.
Scala unifies functional and object-oriented paradigms and provides many
features that are not available in Java. Features such as type members,
pattern
matching and implicits are helpful in eliminating the boilerplate code. In
this
talk, I will illustrate how Scala improves EVF based on some examples and
discuss some issues I met.
