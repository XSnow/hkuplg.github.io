## Abstract

Programming With Intersection Types, Union Types and Polymorphism written By
Benjamin C. Pierce on 1991 is reviewed. This technical report shows a
polymorphic lambda-calculus with intersection and union types. The system is
quite theoretical, and lacks the ability to introduce record-like
intersection
types; but one can define intersection function types. Finitary
polymorphism is
employed in the system, while a more advanced "for" construct is introduced
to
make it even more powerful. An encoding of union types using intersection
types
are introduced by the paper. Finally, I will show some comparisons between
this
system and other practical languages.
