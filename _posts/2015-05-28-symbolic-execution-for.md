## Abstract

Since counter-example generation feature has been introduced, symbolic
execution for property based testing becomes practical and seems to be
effective for finding bugs. In this tutorial-like talk, we will go
through a series of concrete examples together. Meanwhile, a parallel
comparison between QuickCheck and our approach will be conducted to
illustrate the strengths that symbolic execution brings.
