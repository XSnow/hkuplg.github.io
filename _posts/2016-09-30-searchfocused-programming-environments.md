## Abstract

When using external code, we rely on complex interactions within a
programming
environment. This seminar talk will cover challenges that arise in
conventional
programming environments, in particular name conflicts, context dependence,
impedance mismatch of code-related metainformation, and implications of
coarse-grained code distribution. After that, the talk will introduce the
concept of a “search-focused programming environment” which overcomes the
mentioned issues. The talk will describe the key components in this setting:
content-addressable code identifiers, precise dependency tracking, and
uniform
code and metadata storage and access. Finally, the talk will discuss how we
can
adapt existing programming languages to this setting based on implementation
efforts so far.
