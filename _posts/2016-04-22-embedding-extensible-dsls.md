## Abstract

Functional languages are frequently chosen to implement embedded domain-
specific languages (DSLs) whereas Object-Oriented languages are often used
to
implement stand-alone DSLs. We argue that OO languages are better host
languages
than FP languages in terms of implementing extensible embedded DSLs, which
allow
both new syntax and semantics to be easily added without touching existing
code.

In this talk, we will first relate shallow embedding, a semantics-oriented
way
of DSL implementation in FP, to OO decomposition style. And then show how to
extend a DSL with new syntax as well as semantics in an OO language. Also,
some
tricks will be shown for making the surface language fancier.
