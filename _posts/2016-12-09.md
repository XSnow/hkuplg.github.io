## Abstract

Intersection types in traditional OO languages and Î»i both have their
limitation
of expressiveness in accepting all reasonable programs: in the former,
contravariance of function parameters are usually not accepted; so are
typical
function overloading such as the toString method in latter. In this talk, I
will
show how one might get around the drawbacks by having two function arrows
that
differs in their subtyping relation. The resulting type system is going to
enjoy
the best of the two worlds.
