## Abstract

Intersection types can be the foundation of languages embracing
extensibility. Yet many type systems with intersection types are known
to suffer the incoherence problem, which means a program can have
multiple meanings. The lack of coherence leads to unexpected program
behaviours and is not desirable in practice. In this talk, I will show
a simple type system with intersection types, parametric polymorphism,
and subtyping, which is coherent. The current system is inspired by
systems with bounded quantification; the latter supports both
subtyping and parametric polymorphism.
