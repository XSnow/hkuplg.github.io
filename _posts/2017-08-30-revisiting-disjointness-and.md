## Abstract

In this seminar talk I will revisit the ICFP 2016 paper "Disjoint
Intersection
Types" and present a similar calculus where the restriction of disjointness
in
the well-formedness of types is lifted, and show that the most important
property, that is, coherence is not compromised.

The direct consequence of this change is that the original syntactic
approach of
proving coherence does not apply any more. Instead, a more powerful proof
method, i.e., logical relations is used to prove coherence. I will walk you
through the high level overview of the proofs and show that it also
simplifies
the calculus a bit in several aspects.

One advantage of using logical relations is that it is robust to language
extensions, and the coherence proof rarely changes. I will demonstrate that
by
adding one subtyping rule that adds significant expressiveness power to the
calculus.
