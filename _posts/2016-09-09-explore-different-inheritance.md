## Abstract

In this seminar talk, I will explore different inheritance models. Single
inheritance models such as Smalltalk and BETA, multiple inheritance models
such
as CLOS, mixins, traits, CZ, java8, C++ will be explored. We will pay
special
attention to how these models deal with method conflict (especially
unintentional method conflict). Finally we propose a new idea of dealing
with
unintentional method conflict.
