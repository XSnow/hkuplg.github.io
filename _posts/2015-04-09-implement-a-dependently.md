## Abstract

Dependent types bring extra power and expressibility to the
traditional type system but also increase the complexity of
implementation. We present a simple implementation in Haskell of a
dependently typed core language by using bidirectional type
inference. We first show how to implement a simply typed lambda
calculus and expand its typing rules that are necessary for dependent
types. We also write some examples of dependent data types for
executing on top of an interpreter with parser and pretty printer.
