## Abstract

We have seen a lot of cool usage of Object Algebras, and the
extensibility of OAs allows us to build extensible and composible
systems when dealing with recursive data types. But sometimes for some
definitions we need to do pattern matching (which by default OAs
doesn’t support). Using pattern matching is convenient, if not
provided, it would be very hard to define some terms. In this talk,
we’ll do some reviews of OAs, then illustrate the scenario where
pattern matching is needed, then present our idea in Scala, and
finally talk about future work.
