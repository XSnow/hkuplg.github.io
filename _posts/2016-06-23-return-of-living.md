## Abstract

Computing least fixed point problems in a declarative style has returned in
recent years and been successfully applied in many different areas, ranging
from
program analysis to distributed programming. This talk will consist of a
tutorial, explaining basics and terminology of Datalog, and an overview of
the
most recent applications as well as advances, such as new approaches for
programming in this Turing incomplete, yet powerful declarative style.
