## Abstract

The cost of software development is high. To reduce the cost of software
development, object-oriented programming languages have been intensively
used
for developing reusable software components. However, such components are
typically extensible only in one dimension, restricting them from reuse. New
solutions to the expression problem like Object Algebras provide extra
extensibility but restricted in expressiveness. To tackle this problem, we
develop EVF, an extensible and expressive Java VISITOR framework, for
developing
reusable software components.

In this revised talk, I will first show the basic encoding of EVF and how it
addresses the limitations of Object Algebras. Then, I will introduce some
advanced features of EVF like traversal templates and pattern matching,
which
are handy for modeling sophisticated operations. To reveal the
applicability of
EVF, I will show the refactored interpreters from "Types and Programming
Languages" book.
