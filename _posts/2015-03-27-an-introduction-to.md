## Abstract

Context-oriented programming (COP) is an approach to software
modularity. Programming languages and systems that support COP
provides constructs and mechanisms to combine and modularize
behavioral variations, which can be activated and deactivated
according to runtime information about the environment around the
application including the hardware and user preferences and the state
of the objects in the application. Although several context-oriented
programming languages have been proposed, most of them are based on
dynamically typed programming language and type safety has not been
much focused on. This talk will give you a taste of COP in a Java-like
object-oriented programming language and an approach to type-safe COP
in Haskell.
