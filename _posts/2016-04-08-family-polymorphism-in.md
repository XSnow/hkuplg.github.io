## Abstract

Original "Family Polymorphism" paper by Erik Ernst proposes the concept of
family polymorphism, which supports the use of different families of
members,
and composable features in a flexible way, ensuring both code reuse and type
safety. Previous work by Yanlin and Bruno managed to encode a simple
version of
family polymorphism in the Java language, which gives a nice solution to the
Expression Problem, yet leaving some issues to be fixed. Later work
integrated
both previous work on family polymorphism and the Classless Java project,
introducing the new @Obj annotation to make programming and code reuse more
convenient.

In this talk, you will have an overview of this project, including related
work,
what we have done and the future plan. We will focus a little bit more on
the
@Obj annotation and our case studies (applications). Limitations will also
be
discussed during the presentation.
