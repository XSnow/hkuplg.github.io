## Abstract

This talk will summarize problems, motivation, ideas, thoughts,
related work, and development in my second line of work. It will start
off with where we were left off last time, i.e. how to have a more
flexible namespace organization in a typed language, and move onto the
inherit problems of semantic versioning and reproducible builds.
