## Abstract

Giving a set of declarative typing rules for a type system is relatively
easy,
but giving a decidable algorithm is not. In this talk, I will introduce some
work I have done about giving a bi-directional algorithmic typing rule for
dependent types, with explicit type-level computation (casts) and
let-generalization. The work is mainly inspired by the paper "Complete and
Easy
Bidirectional Typechecking for Higher-Rank Polymorphism‚Äù (chosen as paper
reading previously).
