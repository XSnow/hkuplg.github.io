## Abstract

Constructive logic codifies the principles of mathematical reasoning where a
proposition is judged true with a proof, and is judges false with a
refutation.
It associates with programs with proposition as type and proof as
expression. In
this talk, I will give an brief introduction of constructive logic together
with
a little mention of classical logic and their relationship.
