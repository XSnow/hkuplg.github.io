## Abstract

Truffle is a framework for building high-performance interpreters,
based on the new Graal JVM. The combination of Truffle and Graal
allows us to write interpreters instead of compilers, while preserving
high performance. Our proposal is to combine the benefits of
Truffle/Graal and Object Algebras in a Framework for rapid prototyping
of high-performance language implementations.  The key idea is to use
Object Algebras to develop product lines for modular language
components, including Truffle interpreters. We believe the combination
of Truffle and Object Algebras will accelerate the development of
Truffle interpreters and allow easy development of languages in the
JVM.
