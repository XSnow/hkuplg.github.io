## Abstract

Following last seminar talk, in order to support first-class module system
in a
dependently typed language, we study the coercive subtyping system for
dependent
types, which turns out to be challenging enough. In this talk, we show three
attempts of formalizing the coercive subtyping system, each solving some
problems present in the previous one.

We also study the addition of dependent intersection types to the system,
which
also presents some interesting challenges.
