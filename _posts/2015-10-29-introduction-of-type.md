## Abstract

Type inference is considered of great significance for a programming
language, which gives programmers convenience to write programs
without type annotations. This talk covers basic background of type
inference, from simply typed lambda calculus to Hindley-Milner type
system. Further, as complete type inference for some type systems are
undecidable, partial type inference is proposed to deal with this
issue. And with local type inference, the amount of annotations needed
could be greatly reduced.
