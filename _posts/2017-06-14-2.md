## Abstract

There are two different developments in the area of dependent type systems:
investigate type unification techniques for sophisticated dependent type
system;
investigate dependent type systems that give programmer more control, for
example, by explicit casts. The question is: can we get rid of the
complications
of those algorithms in those systems? In this talk, I will present an easy
and
complete unification algorithm for first-order dependent type systems with
alpha-equality based type checking. And I will show how to extend our
strategy
to deal with subtyping for polymorphic types.
