## Abstract

In our last talk, we presented the idea of unified subtyping, which tracks
typing for subtyping relations. We further studied the type system with top
types and improved the non-deterministic rules for top types. We resolve the
circular dependency of the metatheory by breaking the reflexivity lemma
into two
sub-lemmas. The result is a calculus called \I_<: (lambda-I-sub) that
extends \I
with subtyping. A case study of encoding purely functional objects in \I_<:
shows the expressiveness of the calculus.
