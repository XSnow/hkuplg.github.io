## Abstract

In my last talk we discussed a system with intersection types which
elaborated
to the simply-typed lambda calculus. We saw how to ensure that the system is
coherent by restricting the types allowed in an intersection, namely the
ones
which are disjoint. In this talk, we will discuss a possible way of
extending
the system with parametric polymorphism and elaboration to System F.
Coherence
is retained by introducing the notion of Disjoint Quantification. However,
working with Disjoint Quantification is not as straightforward as it might
seem
at a first glance, and we will see how to overcome the arising issues. The
resulting calculus not only is as expressive as System F, but also accepts
programs which use intersection types and/or polymorphic types which may
still
be disjoint after (explicit) well-typed instantiation.
