## Abstract

We present an extension of System F& language with more constructs,
supporting for object algebras. In my last talk, some examples were
presented to illustrate the implementation of object algebras in our
source language. Whereas such implementation could be burdensome and
casual, me and George were inspired to design special syntax for that,
over the last few weeks.

In this talk, I will first remind you of how object algebras can be
implemented currently in our compiler, with simple examples. With
reference to Bruno's grant proposal, our goal is to design special
syntax, so as to make object algebras more explicit and organized, and
possibly simpler. Full syntax of the extended language will be shown
then, together with the translation rules.
