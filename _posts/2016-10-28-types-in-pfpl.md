## Abstract

During my study of book "Practical Foundations for Programming Language",
there
are some facts about types that I find interesting in several calculi. In
this
talk, I will share some of them to explore the beauty of types.
Particularly,
topics involved are "Untyped Means Uni-typed", "Dynamic typing is static
typing", and "Existential types are encodable by universal types".
