## Abstract

Modular Reifiable Matching (MRM) is an approach to enhance the
extensibility in
functional programs. It uses list-of-functors to represent datatypes and
‘Matches’ for first class reusable code pieces. In this talk I will
introduce
its basic framework, some interesting examples and show my attempts to write
modular interpreter using it.
