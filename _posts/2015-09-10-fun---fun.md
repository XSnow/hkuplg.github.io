## Abstract

Recently we submitted a paper about a tiny dependent typed core
language. In this talk, we will demonstrate the expressiveness of the
core language through several use cases. In each use case, we will
briefly talk about the theory behind it, notably the explicit type
casts that we use to replace the conventional conversion rule seen in
most dependently typed languages like Coq, Agda and Idris. Finally we
will compare our work with others', and talk about the future work.
