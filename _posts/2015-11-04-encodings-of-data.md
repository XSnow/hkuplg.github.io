## Abstract

Except adding built-in data types into the language, there are several
encoding approaches to translate them into plain lambda terms. In this
talk I will introduce the Church, Scott and Church-Scott encoding of
data types. Although the encodings look similar, each of them has
certain advantages and limitations. I will also demonstrate that by
examples.
