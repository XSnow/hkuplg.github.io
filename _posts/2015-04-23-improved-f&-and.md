## Abstract

Some time ago, I gave a talk about extensibility with F2J. And later
Haoyuan talked in more details about encoding object algebra in
F2J. However, such encoding is still cumbersome as F2J lacks the
proper syntax support. In this talk I will show you the latest
development of the core language, F&, including some of the important
improvements. I will also discuss the current status of another line
of work mainly by Haoyuan, that is, creating a source language that
supports extensible designs natively.
