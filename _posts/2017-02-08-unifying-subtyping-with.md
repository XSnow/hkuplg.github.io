## Abstract

When introducing subtypes into pure type systems (PTS), the unified syntax
makes
the metatheory complicated. Subtyping relations now need to consider terms,
which causes mutual dependency of subtyping and typing relations. We
propose a
technique to solve this problem by simultaneously tracking types when
defining
subtyping relations. Typing becomes just syntactic sugar of subtyping, which
eliminates the mutual dependency. We study the metatheory of two systems
with
this technique applied to show its feasibility.
