## Abstract

Conventional visitor pattern facilitates operation extensions but sacrifices
data variant extensions. Existing work on equipping the visitor pattern with two
dimensions of extensibility is not very practical, which requires heavy encoding
and/or sophisticated language features. In this talk, we will introduce a simple
encoding of modular imperative visitor that works in conventional
object-oriented languages. We will show the applicability of this design pattern
by modeling several simple DSLs.
