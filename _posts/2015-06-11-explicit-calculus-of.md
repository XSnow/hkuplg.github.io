## Abstract

Following the dependently typed intermediate language that we
presented previously, in this talk, we continue to introduce its
theoretical properties. We will show that explicit type conversion
makes it possible to achieve decidable type checking without
normalization. This also ensures the feasibility of allowing
non-termination in the language. Finally we discuss the left question
last time about the related work by comparing our language with other
similar ones.
