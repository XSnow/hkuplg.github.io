## Abstract

Code generation is a basic concept in computer programming, and is
widely used in various areas of research work as well as software
development. There is so-called "boilerplate code" everywhere in
programs, which stands for "the code sections that have to be included
in many places with little or no alternation" (Wiki). Nonetheless,
with some templates or patterns provided, the generated code can
significantly save a lot of tedious work by hand, and hence improve
the productivity. Such templates are reusable, and easy to maintain.

In this talk, I'll start with the projects that I've been working on
since last year, to illustrate how code generation takes place, and
why it matters in programming. There are several approaches to achieve
code generation, each having its strengths and weaknesses
correspondingly. Some applications of code generation in mainstream
programming languages will also be included during the talk.
